## I am an addon made with Node API in C++.

You can build me, export me as a Javscript module, extend my functionality with your own code ideas, connecting Javascript and C++ functionality together in one binding package. Any importing consumers can get me from '@vendor/hello' in their package.json deps... see 'hello_consumer'!

Please see my package.json to understand how I work.
