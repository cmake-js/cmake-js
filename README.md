# CMake.js (MIT)

## About
CMake.js is a Node.js/io.js native addon build tool which works (almost) *exactly* like [node-gyp](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp), but instead of [gyp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GYP_%28software%29), it is based on [CMake](http://cmake.org) build system. It's compatible with the following runtimes:

- Node.js 10+ since CMake.js v6.0.0 (for older runtimes please use CMake.js 5)
- [NW.js](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js): all CMake.js based native modules are compatible with NW.js out-of-the-box, there is no [nw-gyp like magic](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/wiki/Using-Node-modules#3rd-party-modules-with-cc-addons) required
- [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron) (formerly known as atom-shell): out-of-the-box build support, [no post build steps required](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/using-native-node-modules.md)

## Usage

### General

In a nutshell. *(For more complete documentation please see [the first tutorial](https://github.com/unbornchikken/cmake-js/wiki/TUTORIAL-01-Creating-a-native-module-by-using-CMake.js-and-NAN).)*

- Install cmake-js for your module `npm install --save cmake-js`
- Put a CMakeLists.txt file into your module root with this minimal required content:

```cmake
project (your-addon-name-here)
include_directories(${CMAKE_JS_INC})
file(GLOB SOURCE_FILES "your-source files-location-here")
add_library(${PROJECT_NAME} SHARED ${SOURCE_FILES} ${CMAKE_JS_SRC})
set_target_properties(${PROJECT_NAME} PROPERTIES PREFIX "" SUFFIX ".node")
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} ${CMAKE_JS_LIB})
```

- Add the following into your package.json scripts section:

```json
"scripts": {
    "install": "cmake-js compile"
  }
```

#### Commandline

In your module folder you can access cmake-js commands if you install cmake-js globally:

```
npm install -g cmake-js
```

Please refer to the `--help` for the lists of available commands (they are like commands in `node-gyp`).

You can override the project default runtimes via `--runtime` and `--runtime-version`, such as: `--runtime=electron --runtime-version=0.26.0`. See below for more info on runtimes.

### CMake Specific

`CMAKE_JS_VERSION` variable will reflect the actual CMake.js version. So CMake.js based builds could be detected, eg.:

```cmake
if (CMAKE_JS_VERSION)
    add_subdirectory(node_addon)
else()
    add_subdirectory(other_subproject)
endif()
```

### NPM Config Integration

You can set npm configuration options for CMake.js.

For all users (global):

```
npm config set cmake_<key> <value> --global
```

For current user:

```
npm config set cmake_<key> <value>
```

CMake.js will set a variable named `"<key>"` to `<value>` (by using `-D<key>="<value>"` option). User settings will **overwrite** globals.

UPDATE:

You can set CMake.js command line arguments with npm config using the following pattern:

```
npm config set cmake_js_G "Visual Studio 56 Win128"
```

Which sets the CMake generator, basically defaults to:

```
cmake-js -G "Visual Studio 56 Win128"
```

#### Example:

Enter at command prompt:

```
npm config set cmake_BuBu="kittyfck"
```

Then write to your CMakeLists.txt the following:

```cmake
message (STATUS ${BuBu})
```

This will print during configure:

```
--- kittyfck
```

### Custom CMake options

You can add custom CMake options by beginning option name with `CD`.

#### Example

In command prompt:
```
cmake-js compile --CDBUBU="kittyfck"
```

Then in your CMakeLists.txt:

```cmake
message (STATUS ${BUBU})
```

This will print during configure:

```
--- kittyfck
```

### Runtimes

If any of the `runtime`, `runtimeVersion`, or `arch` configuration parameters is not explicitly configured, sensible defaults will be auto-detected based on the JavaScript environment where CMake.js runs within.

You can configure runtimes for compiling target for all depending CMake.js modules in an application. Define a `cmake-js` key in the application's root `package.json` file, eg.:

```json
{
  "name": "ta-taram-taram",
  "description": "pa-param-pam-pam",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "app.js",
  "cmake-js": {
    "runtime": "node",
    "runtimeVersion": "0.12.0",
    "arch": "ia32"
  }
}
```

Available settings:

- **runtime**: application's target runtime, possible values are:
	- `node`: Node.js
	- `nw`: nw.js
	- `electron`: Electron
- **runtimeVersion**: version of the application's target runtime, for example: `0.12.1`
- **arch**: architecture of application's target runtime (eg: `x64`, `ia32`, `arm64`, `arm`). *Notice: on non-Windows systems the C++ toolset's architecture's gonna be used despite this setting. If you don't specify this on Windows, then architecture of the main node/io.js runtime is gonna be used, so you have to choose a matching nw.js runtime.*

#### Runtime options in CMakeLists.txt

The actual node runtime parameters are detectable in CMakeLists.txt files, the following variables are set:

- **NODE_RUNTIME**: `"node"`, `"nw"`, `"electron"`
- **NODE_RUNTIMEVERSION**: for example: `"0.12.1"`
- **NODE_ARCH**: `"x64"`, `"ia32"`, `"arm64"`, `"arm"`

#### NW.js

To make compatible your NW.js application with any CMake.js based modules, write the following to your application's package.json file:

```json
{
  "cmake-js": {
    "runtime": "nw",
    "runtimeVersion": "nw.js-version-here",
    "arch": "whatever-setting-is-appropriate-for-your-application's-windows-build"
  }
}
```

That's it. There is nothing else to do either on the application's or on the module's side, CMake.js modules are compatible with NW.js out-of-the-box. For more complete documentation please see [the third tutorial](https://github.com/unbornchikken/cmake-js/wiki/TUTORIAL-03-Using-CMake.js-based-native-modules-with-nw.js).

#### Electron

To make compatible your Electron application with any CMake.js based modules, write the following to your application's package.json file:

```json
{
  "cmake-js": {
    "runtime": "electron",
    "runtimeVersion": "electron-runtime-version-here",
    "arch": "whatever-setting-is-appropriate-for-your-application's-windows-build"
  }
}
```

That's it. There is nothing else to do either on the application's or on the module's side, CMake.js modules are compatible with Electron out-of-the-box.

##### Note
Currently Electron (V1.4.x+) can only call modules built using CMake.js from the main process. To call such a module from a render process use the Electron [remote](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/remote.md) module in your require statement:

```var yourModule = require('electron').remote.require('pathToYourModule/cmakeModuleName.node')```

#### Important

It is important to understand that this setting is to be configured in the **application's root package.json file**. If you're creating a native module targeting nw.js for example, then **do not specify anything** in your module's package.json. It's the actual application's decision to specify its runtime, your module's just compatible anything that was mentioned in the [About chapter](#about). Actually defining `cmake-js` key in your module's package.json file may lead to an error. Why? If you set it up to use nw.js 0.12.1 for example, then when it gets compiled during development time (to run its unit tests for example) it's gonna be compiled against io.js 1.2 runtime. But if you're having io.js 34.0.1 at the command line then, which is binary incompatible with 1.2, then your unit tests will fail for sure. So it is advised to not use cmake-js target settings in your module's package.json, because that way CMake.js will use that you have, and your tests will pass.

#### Heroku
[Heroku](https://heroku.com) uses the concept of a [buildpack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks) to define
how an application should be prepared to run in a [dyno](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos).
The typical buildpack for note-based applications,
[heroku/nodejs](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs),
provides an environment capable of running [node-gyp](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp),
but not [CMake](http://cmake.org).

The least "painful" way of addressing this is to use heroku's multipack facility:

- Set the applications' buildpack to
[https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-multi.git](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-multi.git)

- In the root directory of the application,
create a file called `.buildpacks` with these two lines:

        https://github.com/brave/heroku-cmake-buildpack.git
        https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs.git

- Deploy the application to have the changes take effect

The `heroku-buildpack-multi` will run each buildpack in order allowing the node application to reference CMake in the Heroku
build environment.


#### Node-API and `node-addon-api`

[ABI-stable Node.js API
(Node-API)](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html#n_api_node_api),
which was previously known as N-API, supplies a set of C
APIs that allow to compilation and loading of native modules by
different versions of Node.js that support Node-API which includes
all versions of Node.js v10.x and later. 

To compile a native module that uses only the
[plain `C` Node-API calls](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html#n_api_node_api),
follow the directions for plain `node` native modules.

To compile a native module that uses the header-only C++ wrapper
classes provided by
[`node-addon-api`](https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-api),
you need to make your package depend on it with:

    npm install --save-dev node-addon-api

and add it to the include directories of your *CMake* project file
`CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
# Include node-addon-api wrappers
execute_process(COMMAND node -p "require('node-addon-api').include"
        WORKING_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}
        OUTPUT_VARIABLE NODE_ADDON_API_DIR
        )
string(REPLACE "\n" "" NODE_ADDON_API_DIR ${NODE_ADDON_API_DIR})
string(REPLACE "\"" "" NODE_ADDON_API_DIR ${NODE_ADDON_API_DIR})
target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE ${NODE_ADDON_API_DIR})
```
